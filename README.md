# qits-idp-platform-frontend

The identity provider's frontend: the two pages a person arrives at, and the two an operator
administers. Served by qits-platform-idp itself at `/idp/` through Quinoa. Four routes, and they
split down the middle.

- **`/idp/login`** — where a person signs in, with a passkey or a password. No platform chrome.
- **`/idp/register`** — where a person spends a register token to make an account. No chrome.
- **`/idp/clients`** — the clients this provider issues tokens to, inside the chrome.
- **`/idp/users`** — the people who will hold an account, inside the chrome.

**Two of these render no chrome, and that is the shape rather than an omission.** A sidebar full of
links to services the visitor has not been admitted to is an invitation to click something that
will refuse them, and a top bar naming the signed-in user is a lie on the page where nobody is. So
`login` and `register` are top-level routes, siblings of `QitsMainLayout` instead of children of
it. The two administrative pages sit inside it like every other explorer's pages do.

**Every page loads lazily, and this is the platform's first SPA to do that.** The split above is
the reason. Someone at `/idp/login` is by definition not yet allowed to see a client roster, so
shipping the admin pages in the bundle that draws the sign-in form makes the most public page on
the platform pay for code it can never use — and the reverse, an operator downloading a sign-in
form to reach `/idp/clients`, is no better. `QitsMainLayout` stays an eager import: it is the frame
the pages arrive in, not a page, and a frame in its own chunk would show a blank application while
it loaded.

**The two auth pages are real; the two administrative ones are still placeholders.** `login` and
`register` talk to `/idp/api/auth/*` — passkeys through `navigator.credentials`, with a password
beside them — because that surface now exists. `clients` and `users` still draw an empty state and
read nothing, for the reason below. The rule that kept the first two empty has not changed, it has
been satisfied: a form is drawn once its backend answers, and not one commit sooner.

**Passkeys need a secure context, and one real address does not have one.** `localhost` and
loopback count as secure over plain http, so the ordinary `http://localhost:8080` route runs the
ceremony with no TLS. A raw IP does not — and `http://<wsl-ip>:8080` is today's path from a
Windows browser to this platform. Both pages check `window.isSecureContext`, draw no passkey button
where it is false, and say so in one sentence; the password path works from everywhere and is what
automated tests use.

**Registration is gated by a token, not closed.** The platform's bootstrap mints one register token
and prints it in its closing report. The page takes it, spends it once, and the account it makes is
the installation's first administrator. Users are per-installation by decision, so a second
platform starts from its own token — which is also why a passkey's binding to the relying-party id
costs nothing here.

**The client roster is blocked on authentication, not on effort.** `GET /idp/api/clients` takes a
client's own id and secret over HTTP Basic and answers with that caller's own commissions. A
browser has no such pair, and a page asking a person to paste a client secret would teach exactly
the habit an identity provider exists to end. A session now exists to derive a caller from, but the
listing API that would read it does not: the roster is owner-Basic today, and a
session-authenticated read of it is named as open work in the plan rather than guessed at here. So
the page still reads nothing rather than reading it badly.

**Bare `/idp/` redirects to `/idp/clients`, and that line is still provisional.** The front door
should land on whatever the visitor is — a sign-in form when nobody is, an administrative home when
someone is. The question can be asked now that sessions exist; what cannot be asked yet is whether
the answer is this SPA's to give, since the edge is what turns an anonymous navigation into a
`/idp/login?redirect=…` and it does that before this route table is ever consulted.

Note what is _not_ under this SPA even though it shares the segment: this service's protocol surface
sits at `/idp/token`, `/idp/jwks` and `/idp/.well-known/openid-configuration`, beside these pages
rather than under an `/api` of its own. Those are answered by the service and never reach this
application.

## How it is served

qits-idp-platform-service carries this repository as a git submodule at `service/src/main/webui` —
Quinoa's `web-ui-dir` — and builds it during `mvn package`, serving the bundle at `/idp/`. The
segment is spelled here as `baseHref` in `angular.json` and there as
`quarkus.quinoa.ui-root-path`; the two move together. This repository ships no container image of
its own.

That mount is the arrangement this repo is built for, and it does not exist yet: the service
declares no Quinoa and carries no webui submodule at the time of writing. Nothing here waits on it —
this tree builds, lints and tests on its own.

Note the known wart, which is every client's alike: bare `/idp` (no trailing slash) is a 404.
`/idp/` works.

## Development server

```bash
ng serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:4200/`. `proxy.conf.json` forwards this service's whole surface —
`/idp/api`, `/idp/token`, `/idp/jwks`, `/idp/.well-known` and `/idp/q` — to a gateway on
`localhost:8080`, because `ng serve` puts no gateway in front. In a deployment every call is a
same-origin path behind the real gateway.

Sign-in works against that proxy, and it works because the proxy is same-origin. The ceremony spans
two requests and the challenge travels between them in a `_quarkus_webauthn_challenge` cookie the
page never reads; a cross-origin arrangement would drop it and the second call would fail with
nothing on screen to explain why. `http://localhost:4200` is a secure context in its own right, so
passkeys run here — but the relying-party id the service is configured with must match the host the
browser is on, or the authenticator refuses before any request is made.

The platform chrome asks the gateway for `/main-navigation`, which `ng serve` does not proxy — so
the sidebar renders "Navigation unavailable" on the two administrative pages. That is the intended
degraded state, not a fault. The two auth pages mount no chrome and are unaffected.

## Running the checks

```bash
npm run lint && npm test && npm run build
```

The same three, in the same order, are what `.config/qits/ci-event-release-request.yml` runs — once
per release request, on the folded `release/<id>` branch, with its verdict gating the release.
Nothing builds on a push any more.
Note what that pipeline installs from: the npm proxy behind it is qits-platform-mirror, and the
`@qits` scope comes from qits-artifacts — so a run here cannot be green while either service is
down. Their deploys are taken alone, with the CI queue empty.

Installing on a developer machine needs a credential, and it is not in this repository. Every read
through the edge authenticates, so both registries answer 401 without one; `.npmrc` here carries the
routing only, and the `_auth` line comes from your own `~/.npmrc`, minted for your commissioned
workstation client. CI takes both the addresses and the credential from the step environment.

## Building

```bash
ng build
```

The bundle lands in `dist/qits-platform-spa-idp/browser`, which is the path
`quarkus.quinoa.build-dir` names on the service side. Four lazy chunks come out beside the initial
one, one per page — that is the routing above, visible in the output.

## Running unit tests

```bash
ng test
```

Vitest on jsdom — no browser, which is what lets CI run them.
