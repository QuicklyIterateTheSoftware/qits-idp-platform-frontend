/**
 * The four calls that make a person. Two ask the server what ceremony to run, two finish it.
 *
 * **`HttpClient` on the fetch backend, not `fetch` directly** — the house choice everywhere, and it
 * earns itself twice over here. `HttpTestingController` is the only request-mocking story this
 * platform's suites use, and every one of these calls carries cookies the page never touches: the
 * `_quarkus_webauthn_challenge` the options call sets and the follow-up must return, and the
 * `qits-session` the finishing call sets. Same-origin requests send both by default, so the code
 * that makes them correct is the code that is *not* written — no `credentials` option anywhere,
 * because the only value worth setting would be the default and the only value worth fearing
 * (`omit`) would break the ceremony silently.
 *
 * **No `httpResource`.** These are commands, not reads: each one is issued because a person pressed
 * a button, and a resource that re-fetches would re-run a WebAuthn ceremony. Promises, unwrapped at
 * the edge of the service, the way every sibling's API class does it.
 *
 * **Failures are thrown, not described.** An `HttpErrorResponse` reaching a caller here still holds
 * the server's body, and the pages above deliberately do not read it — see `auth/failure.ts`. This
 * class stays the transport and leaves that judgement in one place.
