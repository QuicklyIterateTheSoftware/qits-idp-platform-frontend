/**
 * The wire, written down. Every type here is the shape qits-platform-idp sends or takes on
 * `/idp/api/auth/*`, and nothing here is this application's own idea.
 *
 * **The WebAuthn option types are the JSON ones, not the browser's.** `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions`
 * in `lib.dom` carries `ArrayBuffer` where a JSON document carries base64url text, so the two cannot
 * be the same type and pretending otherwise would push the encoding problem into a cast somewhere
 * further from the wire. These are the text ones; `auth/webauthn.ts` turns them into the browser's
 * and turns the browser's answer back into text.
 *
 * **The server's base64url is unpadded**, which nothing here has to care about — `fromBase64Url`
 * takes either form. It is recorded because a fixture written by hand will usually be padded, and
 * that difference has cost other people an afternoon.
