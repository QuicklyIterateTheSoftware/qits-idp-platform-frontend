type Pending = 'passkey' | 'password' | null;

/**
 * Where a person signs in. A username, a passkey, and a password for the addresses where a passkey
 * cannot exist.
 *
 * **The passkey is the action and the password is the alternative**, and the page says so by
 * layout rather than by argument: the primary button runs the ceremony, the password sits below a
 * rule in smaller type. Nothing secret is typed on the passkey path — the authenticator holds the
 * key, the server holds a public one, and a page that cannot be phished is worth an extra second of
 * a person's attention.
 *
 * **The password half is not a courtesy, it is the only way in from one real address.** WebAuthn
 * requires a secure context; `localhost` and loopback count as one over plain http, so the ordinary
 * `http://localhost:8080` route works with no TLS at all. A raw IP does not — and
 * `http://<wsl-ip>:8080` is today's path from a Windows browser to this platform. There
 * `navigator.credentials` is simply absent, so the ceremony would fail with a `TypeError` and no
 * explanation. `window.isSecureContext` is checked instead and the passkey button is not drawn,
 * with one plain sentence saying why. Automated tests take the same door for their own reason.
 *
 * **Success leaves the application entirely.** The edge sends `return_host` and `return_path` when
 * it turns an anonymous navigation away. The IdP, not this public SPA, validates that host against
 * its configured browser-host allow-list and returns the complete location. A router hop cannot go
 * there, so this is a full document navigation. A login with no return target at all — a typed
 * address, a password manager's saved login URL — asks the same endpoint and gets the
 * installation's landing location, because `/` on this origin is the IdP's own SPA rather than the
 * platform.
 *
 * **There is a `<form>` element, and it never submits.** The sibling explorers build forms out of
 * labelled fields and a `qits-button` with no `<form>` around them, and that shape is wrong on this
 * one page: a password input outside a form is invisible to the browser's own credential manager —
 * Chrome says so in the console — so nothing would ever offer to save the password this page
 * accepts. The element is there for that, and for nothing else. It holds no submit button, so
 * implicit submission never fires; `(keydown.enter)` on the inputs is what makes Enter work, and it
 * dispatches to the action the address can actually run. The `submit` handler is a belt on a pair
 * of braces.
 *
 * **No chrome around it**, by the route table rather than by anything here: this page is a sibling
 * of `QitsMainLayout`, not a child. See app.routes.ts.
