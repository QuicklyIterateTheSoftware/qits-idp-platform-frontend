/**
 * Where a browser lands at the end of `qits login`: one code, large, with a button that copies it.
 *
 * **This page is the redirect target of a public OAuth client**, named as `redirect_uri` and
 * matched exactly by the IdP against a string it builds from its own configuration. A command-line
 * tool has no loopback listener at the moment a person finishes signing in — they may be on another
 * machine entirely — so the code comes back here and travels the last few centimetres by hand. What
 * makes that safe is PKCE: the code is worthless without the verifier held by the process waiting
 * in the terminal, so a code seen over a shoulder, left in a clipboard or caught in a screen share
 * cannot be spent by whoever saw it.
 *
 * **The code leaves the address bar as soon as it has been read.** It arrives as a query parameter,
 * which is the one place a credential is most likely to be written down by something other than the
 * person — browser history, a synced tab list, a bookmark made by accident, an `HTTP referer` on
 * any later navigation. `navigate(… , { replaceUrl: true })` is Angular's spelling of
 * `history.replaceState`: it rewrites the current entry rather than pushing a new one, so pressing
 * Back does not walk into the version of this URL that still holds the code. The code stays in this
 * component's own state, which no other document can read.
 *
 * **It loads nothing from another origin** — no font, no analytics, no icon. Every request this
 * document makes is a request that could carry the URL it was made from, and this URL had a
 * credential in it a moment ago. There is no `HttpClient` call here at all: the page has nothing to
 * ask anybody. That is a property worth stating because it is invisible in the code.
 *
 * **On `?error=` it says the sign-in did not complete.** The IdP sends that when a request it had
 * already decided it may answer turns out to be malformed — and a person reading it can do exactly
 * one useful thing, which is run `qits login` again. So that is the whole message; the code is in
 * the terminal's hands, not theirs.
 *
 * No chrome around it, by the route table: this is a sibling of `QitsMainLayout`, like `login` and
 * `register`. It renders with no session and must — the person may have been signed in already, and
 * a page that demanded one would bounce the finished flow back into a login.
